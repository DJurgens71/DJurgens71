Hey, everyone, my name is Dalen, @DJurgens71.  I'm finally going to start putting some apps and
scripts on here.  I know PowerBASIC very well, PHP, MySQL, HTML and CSS.  

I am currently learning Java and Python lately.  If I don't know how to use it to create a useful 
program, though, I forget it easily.  Is 10,000 hours a real thing?  LOL 

I have created many programs in PowerBASIC that I use at work.  I can create GUI programs that 
have really helped my team at work do their jobs more efficiently.  I like what I can do with 
PowerBASIC.  I have saved my employer a lot of time and money with some of the processes I've 
had to grind through.  I'm glad to know how programming can make a difference!

If you have any questions, please reach me at djurgens71@gmail.com.
